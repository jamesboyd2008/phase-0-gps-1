#Tim Beck GPS 1.1 Reflection
###12/7/15


My first GPS session went really well, at least in my opinion. We got along really well from the beginning, my partner was nice and easy to work with. We were also pretty similar in our methodology, so there wasn't much friction while working through the problems.

Prior to going through this GPS, I still had some questions regarding the process of adding and committing a file to git, specifically about how to visualize different branches, and how merges and things like that do what they do, and more generally about pushing to GitHub - what is actually happening at each step, so why do they break in the way that they do. Both of these issues were resolved through a combination of working through it with my partner, and help from our guide. He was also very helpful in teaching us some shortcuts and tricks for sublime text, like finding text quickly and initializing multiple cursors, which will be really helpful once I'm more comfortable with the shortcuts. 

Nothing really confuses me at the moment, which is definitely an indicator that I'm about to be confused by something.
