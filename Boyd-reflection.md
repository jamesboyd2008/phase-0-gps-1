#First GPS reflection

What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was hazy on the differences between `git pull origin master`, `git fetch origin master`, and `git merge master`.  More importantly, I was hazy on how paired programming might go.  We were faster with each other than we would have been separately.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Some Mac hotkeys were revealed to me, as well as some of the features of sublime.  Additionally, I got a clear answer to my question about `pull` versus `fetch` and `merge`.  Also, seeing that other people go through the git workflow the way I thought it was supposed to be done reinforced my understanding of that.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked questions about everything we typed.  Knowing that other people do things the same way I do them is reassuring.  I still ask about each `git add .` and pushing and pulling.

What still confuses you about git?

I suspect there are more git secrets.  The merge conflict exercise was interesting, especially the part where sublime tells you where the conflict exists.  Still, I am not near lightning fast going through the git workflow, as I highly suspect some people are that fast.  I've seen [gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlIkzgTQ4W0) competitions.  People can be quick with a keyboard and mouse.  Driving vs. navigating is still hazy for me.  I suspect that working with a small group of individuals might further solidify a distinction, to whatever degree that is advantageous.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was positive.  My pair and I seemed to get along well and work together more effectively as a pair on this assignment than we would have alone.  Our guide was a huge help.  He/she knew a lot of cool tricks and answered our questions.
